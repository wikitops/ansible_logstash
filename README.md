# Ansible : Playbook Logstash
The aim of this project is to deploy a simple Logstash client on Vagrant with some default value.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to run this Ansible playbook :

* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/) must be installed on your computer
* Update the Vagrant file based on your computer (CPU, memory), if needed
* You must have download the ubuntu Xenial64 vagrant box :

```
vagrant box add https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/xenial64
```

### Usage

A good point with Vagrant is that you can create, update and destroy all architecture easily with some commands.

Be aware that you need to be in the Vagrant directory to be able to run the commands.

#### Build Environment

Vagrant needs to init the project to run and build it :

```
vagrant up
```

After build, you can check which virtual machine Vagrant has created :

```
vagrant status
```

If all run like it is expected, you should see something like this :

```
$ vagrant status

Current machine states:

logstash01                  running (virtualbox)
```

#### Deployment

To deploy the Logstash client, you just have to run the Ansible playbook logstash.yml with this command :

```
ansible-playbook logstash.yml
```

If everything run has expected, you should deploy parser file in /opt/logstash to manage logs.

#### Destroy

To destroy on what Vagrant has created, just run this command :

```
vagrant destroy
```
